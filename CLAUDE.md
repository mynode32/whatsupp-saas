# Working in this project (read me first)

This is a **GoatStarter kit** — a production-grade Next.js 16 starter built to be
rebranded fast.

## ⭐ If the user wants to set this up

When the user says anything like **"set up this project"**, **"bu projeyi kur"**,
**"make this mine"**, **"configure this"**, or runs **`/setup`** — do NOT start
editing files blindly. Open **`SETUP.md`** and follow it exactly. It is an
interview: you ask a short list of questions (brand, logo, colors, and the
specific API keys this app needs), then you apply the answers to:

- `app.config.ts` — name, tagline, copy, navigation
- `app/globals.css` — brand colors
- `app/layout.tsx` — fonts (optional)
- `.env.local` — the API keys you collected
- `public/logo.svg` — the user's logo (if provided)

Ask **one question at a time**, accept "skip"/"keep default" for any of them, and
never invent API keys. When done, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` and report
the local URL.

## The single source of truth

`app.config.ts` drives the brand, the marketing page, the dashboard navigation,
and the list of integrations this kit expects. Read it before changing UI copy.

## Bilingual (TR + EN)

Every user-facing string is `{ tr: "…", en: "…" }`. When you edit copy, **keep
both languages**. Shared UI strings (auth, nav chrome, buttons) live in
`lib/i18n/dict.ts`. The default language is set in `lib/i18n/config.ts`
(`DEFAULT_LANG`). A live TR/EN toggle sits in the navbar, dashboard topbar and
auth pages.

## Auth

`/login` and `/signup` are real screens but run a **demo bypass** — Supabase
isn't connected, so submitting (or "Continue with demo") just enters the
dashboard. Wiring Supabase via setup is what makes them do real auth.

## Demo mode

With no keys in `.env.local`, the app renders from `lib/demo/data.ts`. That is
intentional — it lets anyone boot the app instantly. Real integrations replace
the demo data once their keys are present.

## This is NOT the Next.js you may know

This is Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4). APIs and conventions may
differ from older training data. If unsure about a Next.js API, check
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code, and heed deprecation notices.
